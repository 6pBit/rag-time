# RAG Time: AI Learning Series

![RAG Time Banner](./images/banner-rag-time.png)

🎉 Welcome to **RAG Time**, a 5-week AI learning series where **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** meets innovation! This repository is your companion to the v**ideo series, containing code samples, step-by-step guides,** and **resources** to help you master RAG concepts.

## Overview

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is a cutting-edge technique combining **search** and **generative AI** to deliver highly relevant and dynamic outputs. With RAG, you can enhance your AI systems by connecting them to vast data sources, making retrieval efficient and generation accurate.

The RAG Time series aims to:

- Teach foundational and advanced RAG concepts.
- Demonstrate how RAG can be applied to real-world scenarios.
- Provide hands-on samples for practical implementation.
- Whether you're a developer, data scientist, or AI enthusiast, this series will guide you through the exciting world of RAG.

## Agenda: Weekly Journeys

RAG Time runs every **Wednesday at 9AM PT** from **March 5th to April 2nd**. Each journey covers unique topics with leadership insights, tech talks, and code samples.
